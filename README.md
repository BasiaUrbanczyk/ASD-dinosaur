This is a project for algorithms and data structures course. For a sequence of letters A, G, C, T in logatithmic time complexity it enables to make operations like: reversing a subsequence, moving a subsequence and finding a maximal coherent subsequence made of identical letters. I'm using a cartesian tree, which combines binary tree and binary heap.
